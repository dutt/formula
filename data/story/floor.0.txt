You're part of the Tsars police for supernatural ...situations, The Black Hounds. Feared by some, respected by all. If they're using magic to do nasty things you will find them and they will learn that actions have consequences. Some far, far worse than others.

Your first solo mission is Arina Danisinya, a respected scientist who has has grown increasingly erratic of late. Now she's shut herself in her tower and strange things are happening. Animals avoid the location, there's lightning from clear blue sky and unnatural noises in the night. People are getting restless, she doesn't answer the door or telegrams. The order has come down, it's time for the Hounds to step in and remove the threat. Kill her.

No backup. No support. This is what you signed up for, this is how we Hounds operate. Go in, get to the top of the tower, fix the situation.

Good luck lieutenant.
