You have reached the end.

Arinas blood slowly cooling on the floor, your blood pounding in your earss, breathing heavy, your wounds hurting.

It's done. The deed complete. Your now a Hound.

You start to climb back down the tower, casting a tired eye over the havoc and carnage you've wrought.
When you step out the door you see Nikolai again, calmly resting against the wall of the tower.

He steps up, eyes you over then smiles and clasps your hand. "Good work Lieutenant, welcome to the pack".

Cry havoc, let loose the Hounds.
