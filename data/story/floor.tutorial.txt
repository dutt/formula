You're part of the Tsars police for supernatural ...situations, The Black Hounds. Feared by some, respected by all. If they're using magic to do nasty things you will find them and they will learn that actions have consequences. Some far, far worse than others.

For this test your formulas are prepared:
- A high damage one
- A ranged lower damage one
- A shield

When you're done with this you will pick your formulas yourself. Part of being a black hound is knowing which tools to pick.

This is your final test, making sure you're ready for the real world.
